# Emotion-Based-Music-Recommender
 In this system, we provide an overview of how music can affect the user's mood and how to choose the right  music tracks  to improve the  user's moods.
  The implemented  system can detect  the user's  emotions. The emotions that the system can detect were happy, sad, angry, neutral, or surprised. After determining the userâ€™s emotion, the proposed system provided the user with a playlist that contains music matches that detected the mood.
  
   The project is to develop an Emotion Based Music Recommender  which  is on web based application meant for users to minimize their efforts in managing large playlists.

   Once the emotion is detected, playlist of songs suitable to the mood of the user will be presented to user over YouTube
